**WARNING** It is not recommended to use any release before v2.0.0. All previous versions are logged and released as pre-releases and are only here as a historical record for myself. All post-v2.0.0 releases are finished products that are stable.

## v2.0.0
With this update, I wanted Roxbot to reach an almost finished state. The base of the program should be complete and functional. This update brings a lot of internal changes that should make development of Roxbot easier for others and myself. It also should make her a lot more stable. Still expect updates with new features, bug fixes, and UX changes. Maybe just at a slower rate.

Roxbot should be easier for users to setup too with this update. I have made full documentation of how she works and how to contribute to the project to make this easier. As well as a setup script.

### Big and Breaking Changes
- All settings have been decentralised between servers and cogs. All changes to the settings have been moved to independant commands. This doesn't effect custom commands or warnings.
- Many commands have had overhalls in how they work. Parameters have changed on a number of commands. Please check documentation on all the commands to familarise yourself with the new way to input params.
- `is_anal` setting is now depreciated.`;suck` and `;spank` now only work in channels marked NSFW. 
- `perm_roles` setting is now depreciated. All commands will work of Discord's permission system.
- Roxbot will now check for a channel being marked NSFW in Discord rather than her own internal system. Roxbot's NSFW channels have been depreciated.

### Regular Updates
#### New Features
- Roxbot Facts! Only the deepest of lore for our dear Roxbot. 
- Custom commands now have two new options. Prefix and Non-Prefix commands can have multiple outputs that can be choosen at random. As well, a new type of prefix cc, embed, will allow custom rich embeds.
- `;warn set_limit` will allow guilds to set the number of warnings before Roxbot will DM a mod about it. This is set to zero (disabled) by default.
- Added `;me_irl` subreddit command that outputs images from the me_irl network of subreddits.
- Added more subreddits to the `;aww` command.
- Changed the main name of the `;gss` command to `;traa` while adding ;gss as a alias. Also added `;trans_irl` as a alias.
- Slowmode now uses Discord's own slowmode rather than its own system. 

#### Minor Changes
- Roxbot will remove all redundant settings (removed roles from self assign, etc.).
- Cogs have a message if they fail to load instead of breaking entire bot.
- Twitch cog disabled and depreciated. This is a minor change because no one uses it anyway. 
- NSFW commands should have even less chance of dupes with better caching.
- All datetime formatting is now standardised.
- Error messages don't timeout anymore.

#### Bug Fixes
- `;deepfry` command now works all the time.
- Pride filter filenames fixed.
- As many spelling mistakes as possible.
- Music bot in Roxbot has had a majority of its bugginess fixed. Queuing now works all of the time for example.
- If music bot can't find a thumbnail for the now playing embed, it will just not have one; Instead of breaking. 
- Fixed bug where nowplaying embeds would have the wrong queued_by value. 
- NSFW commands fixed.
- Roxbot can now fully function in DMs. Before, she would break. DM's have less commands that can be invoked.
- `;subreddit`'s "subscriptable" error has been fixed.
- Common commands that would go over 2000 characters have been paginated to avoid this error.

## v1.8.0
#### New Features
- Image cog with pride flags filters for Pride Month! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (and deepfrying)
- xkcd command. Can grab a random xkcd, or one with a specified id or title. Or even the latest one.
- New `ZÃπÕÄÃπAÃπÃôÃπLÃπÃ¢ÃπGÃπÃßÃπOÃπÕ®Ãπ` command

#### Bug Fixes
- Roll command fixed by Terra
- Fixed an issue where waifurate would still have waifu even with a different gender rate selected. 

#### Misc Changes
- Logging outputs for `aesthetics` and the new command `zaglo` have been changed so that their outputs no longer store what argument was given to the bot. This is to comply with the GDPR and to avoid possibly storing personal information in a channel where the user cannot see and request it's deletion. Instead this has been replaced with the ID of the output message. This should still make the output identifiable for administators.

## v1.7.1
#### New Features
- `warn purge` added to clear warn list of banned users.
#### Bug Fixes
- `warn list` no longer returns error when the list is empty.

## v1.7.0
#### New Features
**Trivia**
- Trivia now has mobile and solo options. Mobile changes the formatting of the questions because rich embeds with Android sucks atm. Solo starts the game instantly and doesn't wait for other users to join.
- Argument passing has changed to accomdate this. To set the length of a game, you need to put `length=short` or other length options after the command. Example `;tr start mobile length=short` would start a short mobile compatible game.
- Trivia can now default on unicode emojis in case the bot isn't in the emoji server.

**NSFW and Reddit**
- NSFW and Reddit commands now have a way to delete the output. This is shown by a delete me reaction that will be added to the output. The person who invoked the command then needs to click that reaction within the 20 second timeout to delete the output.
- NSFW commands now have the same system of preventing dupe outputs

**Misc**
- `onthisday` and `numberfact` commands have been added. Interacting with the numbersapi.com's api.
- `warn` and `purge` can now act on users that have left the guild, if their ID is used as the argument.
- Added more info to the `emoji` command.

#### Misc. Changes
- `avatar` now outputs a png if the image is static.
- EmbedColours are now standardised within RoxBot.
- All of RoxBot's requests are now handled by the http file. All http requests have been moved to aiohttp. 
- requests and lxml have been removed as dependencies of Roxbot.
- `upload` has been disabled for the time being until a way for it to work with aiohttp is found.
- Minor refactoring in places, which involves some directory movement.
- added frogtips cache for quicker frogtips

#### Bug Fixes
- All Voice Bugs have been fixed... for now. Queuing works and some more info has been added to the np output.
- Doubled the amount of times subreddit commands will cycle through possible requests to fix JSONDecode error.
- Fixed error in reddit cog due to changing JSON outputs thanks to new reddit redesign.
- Fixed error when trying to use `warn list` on a user that isn't in the list returning an unhelpful error.
- Fixed `emote` error when using a unicode emote by displaying a helpful error message instead of its non-support.

## v1.6.1

- `waifurate` command can now do husbando and spousu rates as well.
- `pet` command for your headpats needs.
- `roll` command rewrite by TBTerra#5677. It can now do a lot more complex rolls that makes it actually useful!
- `purge` command added for clearing a chat. Only available to users with the `manage_messages` perms.
- `subreddit` and other subcommands should now have a post cache to improve results and reduce duplicate images appearing.
- Internal settings now have automatic and manual local backups. Manual backups activated by the `backup` command.
- Commands are finally case-insensitive. But not the arguments! So don't think your out of the woods yet, kid.
#### Minor Changes
- Logging is now easier internally.
- Logging output has been improved for the `aesthetics` command.
- The `subreddit` command has logging. Only when it is being directly invoked and not when an inbuilt command is being used.
- Added who the `waifurate` command is dedicated to in the command description.
- Added more helpful error handling for `MissingRequiredArgument`, `BadArgument`, `MissingPermissions`, and `BotMissingPermissions` errors.
- Removed pointless second error with iam commands due to improvement to error handling.
- Reddit cog got some lovely refactoring, code should be more efficient now and speeds should be better. Had some weird bugs with loops.
- `subreddit` and other subcommands now will provide author credit.
#### Bug Fixes
- ";-;" and other similar text emoticons now no longer raise the CommandNotFound error.
- `changenickname` has been fixed. Forgot to port some stuff over in there.

## v1.5.0
#### New Features
- New Ban, Kick, and Unban commands.
- New Guild and Role Util commands.
- Logging is now a thing. Just limited to what I was using hack code to do in GSSP. Clean code, happy Roxie.ye
- New feedmevegan command for hungry vegan friends.
- inviteme command for quickly creating an invite link for the bot.
- Added new error catching for the GSSP cog in case the Tatsumaki API dies or something.
#### Refactoring
- Brand new way of storing, saving, and interacting with the guild settings. The new system should be better to read, understand, and shouldn't be as broken as the old version. Really only a note for those looking at the source code as all functionality should be the same other than roxbot should no longer require rebooting to have up to date settings.
- Also a new file structure layout so it looks nice.
- Changed the name of the welcome channel to the greets channel externally.
#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug where using the ;emoji command on a static emoji would return an empty file.
- Fixed bug where roxbot would not have up to date settings at times.
- Fixed the shutdown and reboot commands so they aren't broken anymore.
- Fixed bugs in the gss cog which caused issues from time to time for no reason.
- Fixed an issue where the check failure error would be picked up before it's sub errors meaning they would never be catched by the error handler.
- Fixed the biggest bugs of Roxbot. Fun and CustomCommands where ordered the wrong way in the cog loader, and the GSSP cog's class being called "GaySoundsShitposting" which is just disgusting.
- Fixed bug where conversion error in iam commands didn't raise an exception.
- Added error handling to when you did the self assign commands without any arguments.
